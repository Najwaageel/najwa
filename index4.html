                <p class="card-text"> One of the accounts of the legend of the tulip flower indicates that there is a
                    prince named
                    Farhad who loves a beautiful girl named Shirin, later Shirin is killed, which causes great sadness
                    for Farhad,
                    and in a state of despair, the latter rides his horse down a slope and gets hurt, so that red tulips
                    grow in the
                    places where His blood touched the ground. In another novel, Farhad works in a quarry, and Sherine
                    is a princess.
                    Farhad tries to win her heart, but she refuses him. Then, he climbs the hill and plays music out of
                    love and loyalty to her.
                    When Shireen learns about this, she loves him, but her father refuses; He does not want to marry her
                    to a young man from
                    the common people, and to make marriage impossible, he instructs Farhad to dig a very giant canal,
                    to prove his love for her.
                    Farhad feels miserable, ends his life, when Shireen learns what happened, she moves to the place of
                    Farhad's death, and then
                    ends her life also to be with him, after which the red tulips grow in the place of their blood, as a
                    symbol of complete love
                    that lasts forever.</p>
                <h6> tulip flower also refers in its meaning to new beginnings, which made it a symbol of the
                    celebration of marriage .</h6>
